The original Nokia Here Now application belongs to Nokia. As a consequence, this application is under any Nokia's wishes.  
I don't own anything about this application as I simply ripped up logic and graphic of the original app to port it to a simple Android WebView.

Nokia, I love your products. Be kind to this port.
